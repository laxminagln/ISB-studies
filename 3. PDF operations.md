# PDF operations
### Library for PDF
```python
import PyPDF2                                                 #importing PyPDF2 library
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter               #importing reading and writing components
```
### Merging 2 PDF files
```python
pdf_list = ["path1","path2"]                                  #list of PDFs
write_obj = PdfFileWriter()                                   #the result file content
for i in pdf_list:                                            #for loop
  read_obj = PdfFileReader(i)                                 #reads first pdf
  pages = read_obj.getNumPages()                              #gets number of pages of that file
  for j in range(pages):                                      #nested for loop
    p = read_obj.getPage(j)                                   #gets the info in pages
    write_obj.addPage(p)                                      #adds that page in the resulting file's content
pdf_file = open("path of new file","wb")                      #opens or creates a new pdf in "wb"(since pdf and not txt) mode
write_obj.write(pdf_file)                                     #transfers the resulting content to the new PDF file
```
