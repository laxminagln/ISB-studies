# Manipulating files and folders
### Opening file
```python
file_object = open("filename","mode")                   #use appropriate mode
```
r - read, w - write, a - append, r+/w+/a+ - both read and write
### Writing in file
```python
file_object = open("filename","w")                      #opened in write mode
file_object.write("content")                            #content can be anything
```
### Writing multiple lines in file
```python
line_list = ["content1","content2","content3"]          #any number of contents
file_object.writelines(line_list)                       #use \n to get contents in new line
```
### Appending in a file
```python
file_object = open("filename","a")                      #opened in append mode
line_list = ["content4","content5","content6"]
file_object.writelines(line_list)                       #appends the contents of 2 in 1 below previous lines
```
### Copying a file to another file
```python
file1 = open("filename","a")                            #opened in append mode
file2 = open("filename","r")                            #opened in read mode
info = file2.read()                                     #reads contents of 2
file1.write(info)                                       #writes the contents of 2 in 1
```
### Closing the files
```python
file1.close()                                           #closes file 1
file2.close()                                           #closes file 2
```
### Libraries for file or folder movement
```python
import os                                               #allows to use operating system depedent functionality
import shutil                                           #used for operation on files or collection of files
```
### Operations
```python
os.mkdir("path and foldername")                         #used for making a directory
shutil.move("source path","destination path")           #used to move a folder
shutil.copy("source path","destination path\\filename") #used to copy files
os.rename("source path","renamed file path")            #renaming a file
os.remove("destination")                                #removing a file
```
### Copying multiple files to a location
```python
file_list = ["path1","path2","path3"]                   #file paths declared as list
for file in file_list:                                  #for loop
  shutil.copy(file,"destination path")                  #copies files to folder
```
### Renaming multiple files
```python
re_list = ["source path1",source path2",source path3"]  #list of files to be renamed
for i in re_list:                                       #for loop
  j = i.split(" ")                                      #string is split whereever " " is seen and stored in another list
  desti = j[0] + "repeated part of name"                #new file name is concatenation of previous list element and name
  os.rename(i,desti)                                    #renaming the file
```
